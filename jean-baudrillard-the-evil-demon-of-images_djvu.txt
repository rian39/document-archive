THE INAUGURATION OF 
THE MARI KUTTNA MEMORIAL 
LECTURE ON FILM 

25 July 1984 


'1 



BIOGRAPHIC A I, NOTE 


Mari Kuttna was born near Budapest in 1934 
and, after the death of her father during the war, 
came to Australia with her mother in 1947. She 
was educated at Sydney Girls High School and in 
her final examinations achieved the highest 
results in New South Wales for History and 
English — although this was not her native 
language. In 1956 she graduated from the 
University of Sydney with First Class Honours in 
English and a University Medal, as well as a 
scholarship to the University of Oxford. In 1960 
she married Michael Winton in England, where 
she was to live for the rest of her life. 

Mari Kuttna turned from academic life to life as a 
film critic and translator, contributing reviews to 
Sight and Sound and to Montage, as well as 
writing a regular column for The Lady. Much 
respected for her criticism, she was a member of 
the exclusive London Society of Film Critics. She 
was appointed juror for several film festivals and 
was a member of the panel of judges for the 
British Film Institute. Mari was also a 
programme director for the Oxford Film Festival 
and, in 1982, for the Melbourne Film Festival. 

In the midst of her preparations for the 
Melbourne Film Festival, Mari Kuttna became 
ill with cancer. Courageously she continued to 
work for the Festival and to write her film

criticism until her tragically premature death on 
27 March 1983. 

In 1984 Mari Kuttna's mother, Madame Barbara 
Gre, made a gift of $30,000 to the University of 
Sydney in memory of her daughter. The funds 
were to support teaching and research in film 
studies and thus to continue the work to which 
Mari K uttna had dedicated herself. 


PREPACK 


On 25 July 1984 Professor Jean Baudrillard, of 
the University of Paris-Nanterre, gave the first 
Mari Kuttna Memorial Lecture. 

The Memorial Lectures were set up as a result of 
Madame Barbara Gre's generous gift to the 
University of Sydney; they will enable 
distinguished filmmakers and film critics, 
theorists and historians, both from Australia and 
overseas, to contribute to our understanding of 
the cinema. 

Professor Baudrillard’s lecture, The Evil Demon 
of Images, was given to a large and enthusiastic 
audience which included Madame Gre, the 
Chancellor, Sir Hermann Black, and the Vice- 
Chancellor, Professor John Ward; as well many 
friends came to pay their respects to Mari Kuttna 
and to her work, and, perhaps most significant of 
all, many young people who share Mari Kuttna's 
love of film. 

The Memorial Lecture was preceded by a tribute 
given by the Chancellor and by a personal 
appreciation by David Stratton, former Director 
of The Sydney Film Festival. Edited versions of 
their presentations are included in this 
publication. 

As Director of the Power Institute of Fine Arts - 
in which the Kuttna Bequest is located -- I 
acknowledged the far-sighted generosity of

continuance of the ideals to which she devoted 
her life. j

DEDICATION 


I have to thank a mother for a most generous 
bequest to this University in memory of a 
brilliant daughter who, alas, will come no more. 
It is an heroic generosity, made in the midst of 
her own private sorrow at the loss of a daughter 
in the bloom of her youth and in all the promise of 
a brilliant mind. 

What is it that Madame Gre has done? In March 
this year, she made a gift to the University which 
will be used to develop that in which her 
daughter was so skilled: the engendering of the 
love and understanding of film. This happens to 
be the first public occasion on which you and I can 
thank Madame Gre for what she has done. She 
has created a perpetual remembrance by 
encouraging students of this University to 
develop their understanding of that art to which 
her daughter was dedicated, the art of film. As a 
result, students who, in the passage of time, will 
come to the Power Institute, will have their lives 
enriched and their skills and contributions in the 
area of film criticism enhanced and improved. 

This gift has come as a consequence of a mother 
thinking of how an irreparable loss could be 
turned into some kind of human gain. That is 
what Madame Gre has done. She has given 
immortality to her daughter whose remembrance 
will be in all the generations of students who 
benefit from her bequest.

Dedication 


It is fitting that I, as Chancellor, should say that 
the University is immensely grateful to Madame 
Gre. It is appropriate that I should speak on 
behalf of those future generations who will be 
beneficiaries of that gift. The University is 
grateful; the oncoming generations will be 
grateful; and - if I may speak to Madame Gre 
personally - may your mind be at ease. The 
University will ensure that your daughter will 
always be remembered. 


Sir Hermann Black 

Chancellor of the University of Sydney 


REMEMBRANCE 


I have been asked to say a few words about Mari 
Kuttna because she was a friend of mine. I first 
knew her when she was already established in 
London as a film critic and as a popular and much 
admired member of what is a very closed circle — 
the London Society of Film Critics. 

Mari loved the cinema passionately. That love 
for cinema was manifested in the generosity of 
her criticism — she would find warm things to say 
about gravely faulted films if she knew that they 
were sincere and well-meant. In diligent pursuit 
of her passion for film, Mari engaged in what was 
for a critic unusually extensive travel to festivals 
and film events in order to refine her knowledge 
of her art. Probably her favourite annual film 
event was the week of Hungarian films in 
Budapest, the city of Mari’s birth. There she 
found that special pleasure of hearing films in 
her own first language and in meeting and 
speaking with Hungarian filmmakers. I fancy 
that she took a certain mischievous delight in 
disclosing to other foreign guests at the event 
what was really going on behind the scenes — all 
the things that the officials did not tell us but to 
which Mari had access through personal contacts. 

Around 1980 Mari's enthusiasm for film led her 
to the role of film programmer for the Oxford 
Film Festival, a job which she performed in the 
exemplary manner so characteristic of her. Then, 
late in 1982, Mari was appointed Programme

Remembrance 


Director of the Melbourne Film Festival, an 
appointment which delighted me as it meant 
that, since I was still then Director of the Sydney 
Film Festival, we would be collaborating closely. 
Mari and I met in Budapest in February 1983 to 
begin the process, but I could see that she was not 
well. I did not realise at the time how ill she was 
(Mari did not reveal this to people), but one day I 
was sitting next to her on the bus while she 
pointed out all the places she had been to as a 
child. I think she probably knew she was not 
going to see Budapest again. Later, another 
meeting was arranged in London, but Mari was 
too ill to travel so we discussed the programming 
by telephone. This was the last time I spoke with 
her. 

In 1983 the Melbourne Film Festival dedicated 
its programme to Mari. In Budapest this 
February, the leading Hungarian documentary 
director Pal Schiffer delivered an intensely 
moving tribute to Mari at the General Press 
Conference during the film event. He called Mari 
"a friend of Hungarian film.” I would say more: 
Mari was a friend of film and of filmmaking. She 
was also a friend of Sydney University — she 
loved the years she spent here. Madame Gre, I 
am sure that if Mari could know what is 
happening here this evening, she would be 
overjoyed. That her memory will be preserved 
and fostered through this bequest is, I believe, a 
most appropriate and wonderful legacy for her.

INTRODUCTION 


The Mari Kuttna Lecture on Film will present to 
the Australian public those filmmakers and 
theoreticians of film whose work is the most 
exciting, innovative and challenging in the world 
today. Thus, it was most appropriate that 
Professor Jean Baudrillard be selected as the 
Inaugural Mari Kuttna Lecturer. In numerous 
works, including For a Critique of the Political 
Economy of the Sign, Simulations and In the 
Shadow of the Silent Majorities, Professor 
Baudrillard has established himself as one of the 
world's pre-eminent theorists of the media. His 
writings on the image, on film specifically and 
the media in general, have raised the most 
profound and provocative questions for all those 
who speculate upon contemporary culture. 
Baudrillard theorizes the catastrophization of the 
modern — the extinction of all referentiality, 
whether political, sexual, religious, philosophical 
or other, and the implosion of the discursive 
polarities (subject/object, private/public, 
imaginary/real, etc.) heretofore sustaining 
meaning — in the advent of the mass media, 
which have installed a new reality: the 

hyperreal. For Baudrillard reality has been 
swallowed up in a 'black hole'. Simulation is the 
modus operandi of the hyperreal with models 
preceding and anticipating the 'real', volatilizing 
it and turning it into a 'special effect'. The media, 
television especially, have short-circuited 
meaning, thereby generating a state of

Introduction 


indeterminacy. Baudrillard argues that ours is a 
world of pure operationality, one for which the 
genetic and computer codes offer a perfect model. 
These and other of his ideas, to say nothing of his 
seductive writing style and nihilist stance, have 
found strong reception here in Australia, where 
such leading journals as Art and Text. On the 
Beach, Tension and Local Consumption have 
published major works by him and where, at 
FUTUR*FALL: Excursions into Post- Modernity 
(Sydney, 26-29 July 1984), it was clearly 
evidenced that his ideas have entered into the 
common currency of cultural debate about the 
post-modern.

THE EVIL DEMON OF IMAGES 
Jean Baudrillard 


A propos the cinema and images in general 
(media images, technological images), I would 
like to conjure up the perversity of the relation 
between the image and its referent, the supposed 
real; the virtual and irreversible confusion of the 
sphere of images and the sphere of a reality 
whose nature we are less and less able to grasp. 
There are many modalities of this absorption, 
this confusion, this diabolical seduction of 
images. Above all, it is the reference principle of 
images which must be doubted, this strategy by 
means of which they always appear to refer to a 
real world, to real objects, and to reproduce 
something which is logically and chronologically 
anterior to themselves. None of this is true. As 
simulacra, images precede the real to the extent 
that they invert the causal and logical order of 
the real and its reproduction. Benjamin, in his 
essay 'The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical 
Reproduction', already pointed out strongly this 
modern revolution in the order of production (of 
reality, of meaning) by the precession, the 
anticipation of its reproduction. 

It is precisely when it appears most truthful, 
most faithful and most in conformity to reality 
that the image is most diabolical -- and our 
technical images, whether they be from 
photography, cinema or television, are in the 
overwhelming majority much more 'figurative', 
'realist', than all the images from past cultures.

14 The l vil Demon of Images 

It is in its resemblance, not only analogical but 
technological, that the image is most immoral 
and most perverse. 

The appearance of the mirror already introduced 
into the world of perception an ironical effect of 
trompe-l'oeil, and we know what malefice was 
attached to the appearance of doubles. Hut this is 
also true of all the images which surround us: in 
general, they are analysed according to their 
value as representations, as media of presence 
and meaning. The immense majority of present 
day photographic, cinematic and television 
images are thought to bear witness to the world 
with a naive resemblance and a touching fidelity. 
We have spontaneous confidence in their realism. 
We are wrong. They only seem to resemble 
things, to resemble reality, events, faces. Or 
rather, they really do conform, but their 
conformity itself is diabolical. 

We can find a sociological, historical and political 
equivalent to this diabolical conformity, to this 
evil demon of conformity, in the modern 
behaviour of the masses who are also very good at 
complying with the models offered to them, who 
are very good at reflecting the objectives imposed 
on them, thereby absorbing and annihilating 
them. There is in this conformity a force of 
seduction in the literal sense of the word, a force 
of diversion, distortion, capture and ironic 
fascination. There is a kind of fatal strategy of 
conformity. 

A recent example may be found in Woody Allen's 
film, Zehg: in trying to be oneself, to cultivate 
difference and originality, one ends up 
resembling everyone and no longer seducing 
anyone. This is the logic of present day 
psychological conformity. Zelig, on the other 


The Evil Demon of Images 15 

hand, is launched on an adventure of total 
seduction, in an involuntary strategy of global 
seduction: he begins to resemble everything 
which approaches him, everything which 
surrounds him. Nor is this the mimetic violence 
of defiance or parody, it is the mimetic non- 
violence of seduction. To begin to resemble the 
other, to take on their appearance, is to seduce 
them, since it is to make them enter the realm of 
metamorphosis despite themselves. 

This seductive force, this fatal strategy, is a kind 
of animal genie or talent not simply that of the 
chameleon, which is only its anecdotal form. It is 
not the conformism of animals which delights us; 
on the contrary, animals are never conformist, 
they are seductive, they always appear to result 
from a metamorphosis. Precisely because they 
are not individuals, they pose the enigma of their 
resemblance. If an animal knows how to 
conform, it is not to its own being, its own 
individuality (banal strategy), but to 
appearances in the world. This is what Zelig does 
too with his animal genie — he is polymorphous 
(but not perverse); he is incapable of functional 
adaptation to contexts, which is true conformism, 
our conformism, but able to seduce by the play of 
resemblance. Savages do no less when they put 
on the successive masks of their gods, when they 
'become' their successive divinities — this is also 
to seduce them. It is of course against this 
strategy of seduction that psychiatry struggles, 
and it is what gives rise to the magical 
infatuation of the /crowds for Zelig (in German, 
Selig means 'blessed'). 

The remarkable thing about this film is that it 
leads astray all possible interpretations. There is 
thus also a seduction of interpretation, with the 
complicity of certain intellectuals, as well as a 


16 


The Evil Demon of Images 

polymorphous montage technique which allows it 
to ironically adapt to all possibilities. 

More generally, the image is interesting not only 
in its role as reflection, mirror, representation of, 
or counterpart to, the real, but also when it 
begins to contaminate reality and to model it, 
when it only conforms to reality the better to 
distort it, or better still: when it appropriates 
reality for its own ends, when it anticipates it to 
the point that the real no longer has time to be 
produced as such. 

It is not only daily life which has become 
cinematographic and televisual, but war as well. 
It has been said that war is the continuation of 
politics by other means; we can also say that 
images, media images, are the continuation of 
war by other means. Take Apocalypse Now. 
Coppola made his film the same way the 
Americans conducted the war — in this sense, it is 
the best possible testimony — with the same 
exaggeration, the same excessive means, the 
same monstrous candour ... and the same success. 
War as a trip, a technological and psychedelic 
fantasy; war as a succession of special effects, the 
war become film well before it was shot; war 
replaced by technological testing. For the 
Americans, it was above all the latter: a test site, 
an enormous field on which to test their weapons, 
their methods, their power. 

Coppola does the same thing: he tests the power 
of intervention of cinema, tests the impact of 
cinema become a vast machine of special effects. 
In this sense his film is very much the 
prolongation of war by other means, the 
completion of that incomplete war, its apotheosis. 
War becomes film, film becomes war, the two 
united by their mutual overflow of technology. 


The Evil Demon of Images 1/ 

The real war was conducted by Coppola in the 
manner of Westmoreland. Leaving aside the 
clever irony of napaiming Philippino forests and 
villages to recreate the hell of South Vietnam, 
everything is replayed, begun again through 
cinema: the Molochian joy of the shoot, the 
sacrificial joy of so many millions spent, of such a 
holocaust of means, of so many difficulties, and 
the dazzling paranoia in the mind of the creator 
who, from the beginning, conceived this film as a 
world historical event for which the Vietnam war 
would have been no more than a pretext, would 
ultimately not have existed — and we cannot deny 
it: 'in itself the Vietnam war never happened, 
perhaps it was only a dream, a baroque dream of 
napalm and the tropics, a psycho-tropic dream in 
which the issue was not politics or victory but the 
sacrificial, excessive deployment of a power 
already filming itself as it unfolds, perhaps 
expecting nothing more than consecration by a 
superfilm, which perfects the war's function as a 
mass spectacle. 

No real distance, no critical direction, no desire 
for any 'raised consciousness' in relation to the 
war: in a sense this is the brutal quality of the 
film, not to be undermined by any anti-war moral 
psychology. Coppola may very well dress up his 
helicopter captain in a cavalry hat and have him 
wipe out a Vietnamese village to the sound of 
Wagner — these are not critical, distant signs; 
they are immersed in the machinery, part of the 
special effect. Coppola makes films in the same 
manner, with the same nostalgic megalomania, 
with the same non-signifying fury, the same 
magnified Punch and Judy effect. One can ask, 
how is such a horror possible (not the war, 
properly speaking, but that of the film)? But 
there is no response, no possible judgement. The 



jg The Evil Demon of Images 

Vietnam war and the film are cut from the same j 

cloth, nothing separates them: this film is part of 
the war. If the Americans (apparently) lost the 
other, they have certainly won this one. 
Apocalypse Now is a global victory. It has a 
cinematographic power equal and superior to 
that of the military and industrial complexes, of 
the Pentagon and governments. Nothing is 
understood in relation to war or cinema (at least 
the latter) unless one has grasped this 
indistinguishability -- which is not the 
ideological or moral indistinguishability of good 
and evil, but that of the reversibility of 
destruction and production, of the immanence of 
something in its very revolution, of the organic 
metabolism of every technology, from carpet 
bombing to film stock... 

As for the anticipation of reality by images, the 
precession of images and media in relation to 
events, such that the connection between cause 
and effect becomes scrambled and it becomes 
impossible to tell which is the effect of the other — 
what better example than the nuclear accident at 
Harrisburg, a 'real' incident which happened just 
after the release of The China Syndrome ? This 
film is a fine example of the supremacy of the 
televised event over the nuclear event which 
itself remains improbable and in some sense 
imaginary. 

Moreover, the film unintentionally shows this, it 
is the intrusion of TV into the reactor which as it 
were triggers the nuclear incident -- because it is 
the anticipation and model of it in the day to day 
world: telefission of the real and of the real world 
-- because TV and information in general are a 
kind of catastrophe in Rene Thom's formal, 
topological sense: a radical, qualitative change in 
an entire system. Or rather, TV and nuclear 


The Evil Demon of Images 19 

power are of the same kind: behind the 'hot' and 
negentropic concepts of energy nnd information, 
they have the same dissuasive force as cold 
systems. TV is also a nuclear, chain-reactive 
process, but implosive: it cools and neutralises 
the meaning and energy of events. Thus, behind 
the presumed risk of explosion, that is, of hot 
catastrophe, the nuclear conceals a long, cold 
catastrophe — the universalisation of a system of 
dissuasion, of deterrence. 

The homology between nuclear power and 
television can be read directly in the images. 
Nothing resembles the command and control 
centre of the reactor more than the TV studios, 
and the nuclear consoles share the same 
imaginary as the recording and broadcasting 
studios. Everything happens between these two 
poles: the other core, that of the reactor, in 
principal the real core of the affair, remains 
concealed from us, like the real; buried and 
indecipherable, ultimately of no importance. The 
drama is acted out on the screens and nowhere 
else. 

Harrisburg, Watergate and Network form the 
trilogy of The China Syndrome — an inextricable 
trilogy in which we cannot tell which is the effect 
or the symptom of the others: is the ideological 
argument (the Watergate effect) only the 
symptom of the nuclear (the Harrisburg effect) or 
the informational model (the Network effect)? — is 
the real (Harrisburg) only the symptom of the 
imaginary ( Network , The China Syndrome ) or 
vice versa? Marvellous indistinguishability, 
ideal constellation of simulation. 

The conjunction of The China Syndrome and 
Harrisburg haunts us. But is it so involuntary? 
Without examining any magical links between 


2Q The l vil Demon of Images 

simulacrum and reality, it is dear that^ The 
China Syndrome is not unrelated to the 'real' 
accident at Harrisburg, not by a causal logic but 
by those relations of contagion and unspoken 
analogy which link the real, models and 
simulacra: the induction of the nuclear incident 
at Harrisburg by the film corresponds, with 
disquieting obviousness, to the induction of the 
incident by TV in the film. A strange precession 
of a film before the real, the most astonishing we 
have seen: reality corresponding point by point to 
the simulacra, even down to the suspensive, 
incomplete character of the catastrophe, which is 
essential from the point of view of dissuasion: the 
real so arranged itself, in the image of the film, as 
to produce a simulation of catastrophe. 

It is only a further step, which we should briskly 
take, to reverse our logical order and see The 
China Syndrome as the real event and 
Harrisburg its simulacrum. For it is by the same 
logic that the nuclear reality in the film follows 
from the television effect and Harrisburg in 
'reality' follows from the cinema effect of The 
China Syndrome. 

But the latter is not the original prototype of 
Harrisburg; one is not the simulacrum and the 
other the reality: there a.re only simulacra, and 
Harrisburg is a kind of simulation in the second 
degree. There is indeed a chain reaction; but it is 
not the nuclear chain reaction but that of the 
simulacra and of the simulation in which all the 
energy of the real is effectively engulfed, not in a 
spectacular nuclear explosion but in a secret and 
continuous implosion, which is perhaps taking a 
more deadly turn than all the explosions which 
presently lull us. 


The Evil Demon of Images PI 

For an explosion is always a promise, it is our 
hope: see how much, in the film as well as at 
Harrisburg, everyone expects it to go up, that 
destruction speak its name and deliver us from 
this unnameable panic, from this invisible 
nuclear panic of dissuasion. Let the 'core' of the 
reactor expose at last its glowing power of 
destruction, let it reassure us as to the admittedly 
catastrophic presence of energy and gratify us 
with its spectacle. For the problem is that there 
is no nuclear spectacle, no spectacle of nuclear 
energy in itself (Hiroshima is past): it is for this 
reason that it is rejected — it would be perfectly 
accepted if it lent itself to spectacle like earlier 
forms of energy. Parousia of catastrophe: 
substantial boost to our messianic libido. 

But that will never recur. What will happen will 
never be explosion but implosion. Never again 
will we see energy in its spectacular and pathetic 
form — all the romanticism of explosion which 
had so much charm, since it was also that of 
revolution -- but only the cold energy of 
simulacra and its distillation in homeopathic 
doses into the cold systems of information. 

What else does the media dream of if not raising 
up events by its very presence? Everyone 
deplores it, but everyone is secretly fascinated by 
this eventuality. Such is the logic of simulacra: 
no longer divine predestination, but the 
precession of models, which is no less inexorable . 
And it is for this reason that events no longer 
have any meaning: not because they are 
insignificant in themselves, but because they 
have been preceded by models with which their 
own process can only coincide. 

For some time now, in the dialectical relation 
between reality and images (that is, the relation 


ir 


22 


I hr I vil Demon of Images 

that we wish to believe dialoctieal, readable from 
the real to the image and vice versa),. the image 
has taken over and imposed its own immanent, 
ephemeral logic; an immoral logic without depth, 
beyond good and evil, beyond truth and falsity; a 
logic of the extermination of its own referent, a 
logic of the implosion of meaning in which the 
message disappears on the horizon of the 
medium. In this regard, we all remain incredibly 
naive : we always look for a good usage of the 
image, that is to say a moral, meaningful, 
pedagogic or informational usage, without seeing 
that the image in a sense revolts against this 
good usage, that it is the conductor neither of 
meaning nor good intentions, but on the contrary 
of an implosion, a denegation of meaning (of 
events, history, memory, etc.). I am reminded of 
Holocaust, the television series on the 
concentration camps... 

Forgetting the extermination is part of the 
extermination itself. That forgetting, however, is 
still too dangerous and must be replaced by an 
artificial memory (everywhere, today, it is 
artificial memories which obliterate people's 
memories, which obliterate people from memory). 
This artificial memory replays the extermination 
- but too late for it to profoundly unsettle 
anything, and above all it does so via a medium 
which is itself cold, radiating oblivion, dissuasion 
and extermination in an even more systematic 
manner, if this is possible, than the camps 
themselves. TV, the veritable final solution to 
the historicity of every event. The Jews are 
recycled not through the crematory ovens or the 
gas chambers but through the sound track and 
images, through the cathode tube and the micro- 
chip. Forgetting, annihilation thereby achieves 
at last an aesthetic dimension — nostalgia gives 
them their final finish. 


The Evil Demon of Images 23 

Henceforth, "everyone knows”, everyone has 
trembled before the extermination — a sure sign 
that "it” will never happen again. But in effect 
what is thus exorcised so cheaply, at the cost of a 
few tears, will never recur because it is presently 
happening in the very form through which it is 
denounced, through the very medium of this 
supposed exorcism: television. The same process 
of forgetting, of liquidation, of extermination, the 
same annihilation of memories and of history, the 
same inverse, implosive radiation, the same 
absorption without trace, the same black hole as 
Auschwitz. They want us to believe that TV will 
remove the mortgage of Auschwitz by raising 
collective consciousness, whereas it is the 
perpetuation of it in a different guise, under the 
auspuces not of a site of annihilation but a 
medium of dissuasion. 

What everyone fails to understand is that 
Holocaust is above all (and exclusively) a 
televised event or rather object (McLuhan's 
fundamental rule which must not be forgotten). 
That is to say, it is an attempt to reheat a cold 
historical event — tragic but cold, the first great 
event of cold systems, those cooling systems of 
dissuasion and extermination which were 
subsequently deployed in other forms (including 
the Cold War, etc.) and in relation to the cold 
masses (the Jews no longer even concerned by 
their own death, eventually self-managing it, no 
longer even masses in revolt: dissuaded unto 
death, dissuaded even of their own death). To 
reheat this cold event via a cold medium, 
television, for masses who are themselves cold, 
who will only find in it the occasion for a tactile 
chill and a posthumous emotion, a dissuasive 
shiver, which sends them into oblivion with a 
kind of aesthetic good faith.

24 The I vi I Demon of Images 

The cold light of television is inoffensive to the 
imagination (even that of children) since it no 
longer carries any imaginary, for the simple 
reason that it is no longer an image. 

In this sense the TV image has to be placed in 
opposition to the cinema, which still carries an 
intense imaginary. Although it is contaminated 
more and more by TV, the cinema is still an 
image — that means not only a screen and a 
visual form but a myth, something that belongs 
to the sphere of the double, the phantasm, the 
mirror, the dream, etc... Nothing of that in the 
TV image, which doesn't suggest anything and 
has a magnetic effect. The TV image is only a 
screen. More than that: a miniaturized terminal 
located in your head and you are the screen and 
the TV looks at you, goes through you like a 
magnetic tape — a tape, not an image. 

Thus, properly speaking it is Holocaust the 
television film which constitutes the definitive 
holocaust event. Likewise, with The Day After it 
is not the atomic conflict depicted in the film but 
the film itself which is the catastrophic event. 

This film should inspire a salutary terror, it 
should dissuade by the spectacle of terror. 
However, I don't see anything as a result of this 
film. The slides at the New York Museum of 
Natural History move me much more 
profoundly : you can shiver at the ice age and feel 
the charm of the prehistoric, but here I feel 
neither the shiver nor the charm of nuclear 
power, nor even suspense nor the final blinding 
flash. 

Is it a bad film? Certainly. But isn't it rather 
that all this is unimaginable? Isn't it rather that, 


The Evil Demon of Images 25 

in our imaginary, nuclear conflict is a total event, 
without appeal and with no tomorrow, whereas 
here it simply brings about, a regression of the 
human race accord i ng to the worst naive 
stereotypes of savagery? But we already know 
that state, indeed we have barely left it. Our 
desire is rather for something which no longer 
takes place on a human scale, lor some anterior 
or ulterior mystery: what will the earth be like 
when we are no longer on it? In a word, we dream 
of our disappearance, and of seeing the world in 
its inhuman purity (which is precisely not the 
state of nature). 

But these limits, these extremes that we imagine, 
this catastrophe -- can it be metaphorised in 
images? It is not certain that its mythical 
evocation is possible, any more than that of our 
bio-molecular destiny or that of the genetic code, 
which is the other dimension, the corollary of the 
nuclear. We can no longer be affected by it -- 
proof that we have already been irradiated! 
Already to our minds the catastrophe is no more 
than a comic strip. Its filmic projection is only a 
diversion from the real nuclearisation of our 
lives. The real nuclear catastrophe has already 
happened, it happens every day, and this film is 
part of it. It is it which is our catastrophe. It does 
not represent it, it does not evoke it, on the 
contrary it shows that it has already happened, 
that it is already here, since it is impossible to 
imagine. 

For all these reasons I do not believe in a 
pedagogy of images, nor of cinema, nor a fortiori 
in one of television. I do not believe in a dialectic 
between image and reality, nor therefore, in 
respect of images, in a pedagogy of message and 
meaning. The secret of the image (we are still 
speaking of contemporary, technical images) 


26 


The Evil Demon of Images 

must not be sought in its differentiation from 
reality, and hence in its representative value 
(aesthetic, critical or dialectical), but on the 
contrary in its 'telescoping' into reality, its short- 
circuit with reality, and finally, in the implosion 
of image and reality. For us there is an 
increasingly definitive lack of differentiation 
between image and reality which no longer 
leaves room for representation as such. 

This collusion between images and life, between 
the screen and daily life, can be experienced 
everyday in the most ordinary manner. 
Especially in America, not the least charm of 
which is that even outside the cinemas the whole 
country is cinematographic. You cross the desert 
as if in a western; the metropolis is a continual 
screen of signs and formulae. Life is a travelling 
shot, a kinetic, cinematic, cinematographic 
sweep. There is as much pleasure in this as in 
those Dutch or Italian towns where, upon leaving 
the museum, you rediscover a town in the very 
image of the paintings, as if it had stepped out of 
them. It is a kind of miracle which, even in a 
banal American way, gives rise to a sort of 
aesthetic form, to an ideal confusion which 
transfigures life, as in a dream. Here, cinema 
does not take on the exceptional form of a work of 
art, even a brilliant one, but invests the whole of 
life with a mythical ambience. Here it becomes 
truly exciting. This is why the idolatry of stars, 
the cult of Hollywood idols, is not a media 
pathology but a glorious form of the cinema, its 
mythical transfiguration, perhaps the last great 
myth of our modernity. Precisely to the extent 
that the idol no longer represents anything but 
reveals itself as a pure, impassioned, contagious 
image which effaces the difference between the 
real being and its assumption into the imaginary. 


The Evil Demon of Images 27 

All these considerations are a bit wild, but that is 
because they correspond to the unrestrained film 
buff that I am and have always wished to remain 
— that is in a sense uncultured and fascinated. 
There is a kind of primal pleasure, of 
anthropological joy in images, a kind of brute 
fascination unencumbered by aesthetic, moral, 
social or political judgements. It is because of 
this that I suggest they are immoral, and that 
their fundamental power lies in this immorality. 

This brute fascination for images, above and 
beyond all moral or social determination, is also 
not that of dreaming or the imaginary, 
understood in the traditional sense. Other 
images, such as those in painting, drawing, 
theatre or architecture, have been better able to 
make us dream or imagine; other modes of 
expression as well (undoubtedly language makes 
us dream better than the image). So there is 
something more than that which is peculiar to 
our modern media images: if they fascinate us so 
much it is not because they are sites of the 
production of meaning and representation — this 
would not be new — it is on the contrary because 
they are sites of the disappearance of meaning 
and representation, sites in which we are caught 
quite apart from any judgement of reality, thus 
sites of a fatal strategy of denegation of the real 
and of the reality principle. 

We have arrived at a paradox regarding the 
image, our images, those which unfurl upon and 
invade our daily life -- images whose 
proliferation, it should be noted, is potentially 
infinite, whereas the extension of meaning is 
always limited precisely by its end, by its finality: 
from the fact that images ultimately have no 
finality and proceed by total contiguity, infinitely 
multiplying themselves according to an 



1 


28 The l vil Demon of Images 

irresistible epidemic process which no one today 
can control, our world has become truly infinite, 
or rather exponential by means of images. It is 
caught up in a mad pursuit of images, in an ever 
greater fascination which is only accentuated by 
video and digital images. We have thus come to 
the paradox that these images describe the equal 
impossibility of the real and of the imaginary. 

For us the medium, the image medium, has 
imposed itself between the real and the 
imaginary, upsetting the balance between the 
two, with a kind of fatality which has its own 
logic. I call this a fatal process in the sense that 
there is a definitive immanence of the image, 
without any possible transcendent meaning, 
without any possible dialectic of history — fatal 
also in the sense not merely of an exponential, 
linear unfolding of images and messages but of 
an exponential enfolding of the medium around 
itself. The fatality lies in this endless 
enwrapping of images (literally: without end, 
without destination) which leaves images no 
other destiny than images. The same thing 
happens everywhere today, when production has 
no destiny apart from production -- 
overdetermination of production by itself — when 
sex has no destiny other than sex — sexual 
overdetermination of sexuality. This process 
may be found everywhere today, for better and 
for worse. In the absence of rules of the game, 
things become caught up in their own game: 
images become more real than the real; cinema 
itself becomes more cinema than cinema, in a 
kind of vertigo in which (to return to our initial 
problem, that of resemblance) it does no more 
than resemble itself and escape in its own logic, 
in the very perfection of its own model. 


The Evil Demon of Images S9 

I am thinking of those exact, scrupulous set 
pieces such as Chinatown , The l)a y of the Condor, 
Barry Lyndon , 1900, All the /’resident's Men , the 
very perfection of which is disturbing. It is as i I 
we were dealing with perfect remakes, with 
extraordinary montages which belong more to a 
combinatory process (or mosaic in the 
McLuhanesque sense), with large photo, kino or 
historio-synthetic machines, rather than with 
real films. Let us be clear: their quality is not in 
question. The problem is rather that they leave 
us somehow totally indifferent. 

Take The Last Picture Show. You need only be 
sufficiently distracted, as 1 was, to see it as a 
1950s original production: a good film of 
manners and the ambience of small town 
America, etc. A slight suspicion: it was a little 
too good, better adjusted, better than the others, 
without the sentimental, moral and psychological 
tics of the films of that period. Astonishment at 
the discovery that it is a 1970s film, perfectly 
nostalgic, brand new, retouched, a hyperrealist 
restitution of a 50s film. There is talk of 
remaking silent films, doubtless better than 
those of the period. A whole generation of films 
is appearing which will be to those we have 
known what the android is to man: marvellous, 
flawless artifacts, dazzling simulacra which lack 
only an imaginary and that particular 
hallucination which makes cinema what it is 
Most of those that we see today (the best) are 
already of this order. Barry Lyndon is the heal 
example: no better has been made, no better will 
be made, but what exactly? Evocation? No, not 
even evocation but simulation. All the toxic 
radiation has been filtered out, all the 
ingredients are present in precise doses, not a 
single mistake.

The tvil Demon of Images 

Cool, cold pleasure which is not even aesthetic 
properly speaking: functional pleasure, 
equational pleasure, pleasure of machination. 
We need only think of Visconti (The Leopard, 
Senso, etc., which recall Barry Lyndon in certain 
respects) in order to grasp the difference, not only 
in style but in the cinematographic act. With 
Visconti, there is meaning, history, a sensual 
rhetoric, dead moments, a passionate game, not 
only in the historical content but in the direction. 
None of that with Kubrick, who controls his film 
like a chessboard, and makes history an 
operational scenario. Nor does this refer back to 
the old opposition between finesse and geometry: 
there meaning was still in play, meaning was at 
stake. Whereas we are entering into an era of 
films which no longer have meaning properly 
speaking, large synthetic machines with variable 
geometry. 

Is there already something of this in Sergio 
Leone's westerns? Perhaps. All registers tend in 
this direction. Chinatown is the detective story 
redesigned by laser. It is not really a question of 
perfection. Technical perfection can belong to the 
meaning, and in this case it is neither nostalgic 
nor hyperrealist; it is an effect of art. Here, it is 
an effect of model: it is one of the tactical 
reference values. In the absence of any real 
syntax of meaning there are only tactical values 
in a complex whole in which, for example, the 
CIA as an all-purpose mythological machine, 
Robert Redford as a polyvalent star, social 
relations as necessary references to history, and 
technical virtuosity as a necessary reference to 
cinema are all admirably combined. 

Cinema and its trajectory: from the most 
fantastic or mythical to the realistic and 
hyperrealistic. 


The Evil Demon of Images 31 

In its present endeavours cinema increasingly 
approaches, with ever increasing perfection, 
absolute reality: in its banality, in its veracity, in 
its starkness, in its tedium, and at the same time 
in its pretentiousness, in its pretention to be the 
real, the immediate, the unsignified, which is the 
maddest of enterprises (in the same way that the 
pretention of functionalist design to designate, as 
the highest degree of the object, the form in which 
it coincides with its function, its use-value, is 
properly an insane enterprise). No culture has 
ever had this naive and paranoiac, this 
puritanical and terrorist vision of signs. 
Terrorism is always of the real. Simultaneous 
with this attempt at absolute coincidence with 
the real, cinema also approaches an absolute 
coincidence with itself. This is not contradictory : 
it is the very definition of the hyperreal. 
Hypotyposis and specularity. Cinema plagiarises 
and copies itself, remakes its classics, 
retroactivates its original myths, remakes silent 
films more perfect than the originals, etc. All 
this is logical. Cinema is fascinated, by itself as a 
lost object just as it (and we) are fascinated by the 
real as a referential in perdition. Previously there 
was a living, dialectical, full and dramatic 
relationship between cinema and the imaginary 
(that is, novelistic, mythical unreality, even 
down to the delirious use of its own technique). 
Today, there is an inverse negative relation 
between the cinema and reality: it results from 
the loss of specificity which both have suffered. 
Cold collage, cool promiscuity, asexual 
engagement of two cold media which evolve in 
asymptotic line towards one another : cinema 
attempting to abolish itself in the absolute of 
reality, the real already long, absorbed in 
cinematographic (or televised) by per reality.

36 Interview wilh Jean Baudrillard 

There is ;i play on words in the text morality, 
amorality, immorality -- which 1 think is 
absolutely essential here. The point is that 
amorality as a concept is not very interesting or 
challenging. The concept of immorality, on the 
contrary, is far more dramatic. 

Take Nietzsche's treatment of God, for instance. 
What Nietzsche says is that God is dead. This is 
a far more interesting situation than if Nietzsche 
were to simply say "there is no God” or "God has 
never existed”, etc. — that would be mere atheism 
— whereas to say that God is dead as Nietzsche 
does is to say something far more dramatic, and 
really something else altogether: it is an attempt 
to go beyond God. Similarly, the word 
'immorality' as used in the text is an attempt to 
go beyond not just morality but also amorality. It 
is certainly an attempt to state the disappearance 
of morality, but also to situate the ensuing game 
at a level different from mere amorality itself. 

A.C.: So Nietzsche is not a mere atheist. 

J.B.: Yes, Nietzsche is not in the least an 

ordinary 'atheist'. He is not committed to the 
denial of the existence of God as an ordinary 
atheist would be. He is actually denying not that 
God exists but that God is alive. He is saying 
that God is dead, and that is a fundamental 
concept. 

The concept is similar to my concept of 'challenge' 
in De la Seduction. This is the idea that the 
disappearance of something is never objective, 
never final — it always involves a sort of 
challenge, a questioning, and consequently an act 
of seduction. In almost everything that I have 
written, there is this challenge to morality, to 
reality, etc. So Nietzsche, for example, 


Interview with Jean Baudrillard 37 

challenges the existence of God by issuing a 
challenge to God. It isjust as uninteresting to say 
"God does not exist” as to say "God exists”. The 
problematic for Nietzsche is completely different. 
He is challenging the 'liveliness', the being, of 
God. In other words, he is seducing God. 
Similarly, in my work what I try to do is to issue a 
challenge to meaning and to reality, to seduce 
them and to play with them... 

T.C./D.K.: To play the devil's advocate, there 
does seem to be, in this text, both an ethical 
vocabulary, implying a position to be adopted, 
and a more or less urgent directive to come to 
grips with the indistinguishability between the 
real and the order of simulation. To an audience 
this might imply one of two modes of address: 

On the one hand a soliloquy, maybe 
dispassionate, that nonetheless plays a part in 
the dramaturgy of the final act — the eclipse of 
history, the vanishing of the real. In this case can 
we understand this text to be the words of a 
provocateur — intervening to precipitate, or 
arrest, this devolution; or rather those of an 
analyst — commenting upon and clarifying this 
action? In other words, does this text have a role 
to play? 

On the other hand could this be an ironic aside, 
neither participating in the action nor critically 
detached from it, a knowing remark that clues us 
in but is, for all that, inconsequential? 

J.B.: Well, congratulations on an excellent 

question. It deals with an important problem: the 
position of a text (and especially of a text such as 
this one), as well as the position being adopted in 
the text in relation to its object — or at least the 
object as described by the text itself. In the sense 



38 


Interview with Jean Baudrillard 


Interview with Jean Baudrillard 


39 


that the text attempts to move towards the end of 
something - towards a sort of catastrophe, a 
something Inst — there is indeed an (dement of 
provocation, since the text must he situated 
within its own logic, within its own processes. 
There is provocation in that one wishes to 
accelerate this logic. One goes therefore in the 
same direction as the text — but one accelerates, 
one goes much faster towards the end of the text. 
And one plays on the logic itself to be able (at 
least) to reach a point beyond it, so as to make the 
system reveal itself more clearly. It is more or 
less a strategic position that one adopts: one of 
precipitation, of acceleration, as demanded by the 
text itself. 

Nevertheless, I do not for all that abandon in any 
way the position of the analyst. There is here 
perhaps an ambiguity, an ambivalence, which is 
quite fundamental. On the one hand we have a 
position which is strategically necessary, and on 
the other hand we retain the position of the 
analyst. This ambiguity probably remains 
throughout the text at every point. One is 
compelled to produce meaning in the text, and 
one produces this meaning as if it arises from the 
system (even if in fact the system lacks meaning) 
in order precisely to play that meaning against 
the system itself as one reaches the end. So there 
is a position here — a third position — which I 
would describe as that of objective irony. 

Objective irony is not subjective irony: it is not an 
irony based on solipsism or on any separation of 
discourse from the subject. Objective irony is 
precisely the irony whereby one is able to turn 
the system, to make it work against itself, to play 
against itself. This creates an ironic effect within 
the text, since its position is bound to be 
ambiguous. In other words, one always in a sense 


remains the subject of a discourse, any discourse, 
so one always in a sense assumes the position of 
an analyst. But then, one must also exert the 
same strategy to the object of discourse: in the 
same way that one works with the subject, one 
must also work towards the position of pure 
object, towards the ’vanishing point' of discourse 
itself. 

Consequently I do not think that one has to 
choose one way or another. What the text 
involves, simultaneously, is both provocation and 
analysis. There is a simultaneous requirement to 
give meaning to the text (analysis) and to also 
give an end to that meaning (provocation). And 
what really differentiates this procedure from 
other processes of negation for example, the 
negative dialectic of Adorno is precisely what I 
call objective irony. That is, there is a movement 
within the text, from subjective irony as used by 
Adorno and others (based on the irony of the 
subject) to objective irony the irony of the object 
itself. What I try to do, if you like, is to try to get 
out of the subjectivity/objectivity dialectic, in 
order to reach a point where 1 can make of the 
system an object, a pure object, one with no 
meaning whatsoever. I try, in other words, to 
constitute the subject of discourse in turn as an 
object; I try to create a sort of distance (which is 
not a 'critical' but an 'ironic' distance) between 
the subject and the text — and when this occurs, 
then of course the position of the analyst 
disappears. 

And yet, while one remains within a theoretical 
type of discourse, within a discourse such as this 
one, one cannot exclude oneself from any of these 
positions. I do not have to choose — and I would 
hesitate to choose — between any of them. All 
three positions have their place in the game as it

proceeds - and this is in itself', of course, the 
supremo i rony of the text. 

T.C./D.K.: You have titled this paper The Evil 
Demon of Images. In the Meditations Descartes 
refers to an evil demon that can conjure an 
inexistent world that includes the inexistent 
figure of Descartes himself. Descartes was able 
to exile that demon through corrosive doubt, 
confirming the world and its objects; here you 
have conjured that evil demon's return, exiling 
instead both doubt and the real. How would you 
describe the relation between this text and the 
Cartesian project it seems to invoke? 

J.B.: In the Cartesian project there is at least the 
inauguration of a rational principle. It is from 
this rational principle that the whole question of 
doubt arises. This doubt comes from the subject -- 
as subject of knowledge, as subject of discourse. 

Whether Descartes in fact succeeds in making 
the subject constitute itself, in its reality, in 
relation to a diabolical world which is full of 
superstitions and hallucinations and so on is a 
controversial matter. But the fact remains that 
Cartesian doubt is based on the promise of a 
world which can be confirmed only in terms of its 
own reality: there is doubt on the one hand and 
there is reality on the other hand; and there is the 
conflict between the two, which Descartes tries to 
resolve. 

For me the question is totally different. When I 
evoke the principle of evil, of an evil demon etc., 
my aim is more closely related to a certain kind of 
Manichaeism. It is therefore anterior to 
Descartes, and fundamentally it is irrational. 
There are in fact two principles at stake: on the 
one hand there is the (Descartes') rational 


principle or principle of rationality -- the 
fundamental attempt, through doubt or anything 
else, to rationalise the world and on the other 
hand there is the inverse principle, which was, 
for example, adopted by the 'heretics' all the way 
throughout the history of Christianity. This is 
the principle of evil itself. What the heretics 
posited was that the very creation of the world, 
hence the reality of the world, was the result of 
the existence of the evil demon. The function of 
God, then, was really to try to repudiate this evil 
phantom — that was the real reason why God had 
to exist at all. So in this situation it is no longer a 
question of doubt or non doubt, of whether one 
should exercise this doubt or whether this doubt 
could lead us to confirm or deny the existence of 
the world. Rather, it is once again the principle 
of seduction that needs to be invoked in this 
situation: according to Manichaeism, the reality 
of the world is a total illusion; it is something 
which has been tainted from the very beginning; 
it is something which has been seduced by a sort 
of irreal principle since time immemorial. In this 
case what one has to invoke is precisely this 
absolute power of illusion -- and this is indeed 
exactly what the heretics did. They based their 
theologies on the very negation of the real. Their 
principal and primary convention was that of the 
non-reality, hence of the non-rationality, of the 
world. They believed that the world, its reality, 
is made up only of signs -- and that it was 
governed solely through the power of the mind. 

This idea of the world as being constituted only 
by signs is, if you like, some sort of magic 
thinking — and indeed it was condemned as such. 
For it does entail that the 'real' — and any sort of 
'reality' — that one sees in the world is quite 
simply an absolute utopia. The rationality that 
one has to invoke in order to make the world 'real' 


42 


Interview with Jean Baudrillard 


Interview with Jean Baudrill.mJ 


43 


is really just a product of the power of thought 
itself, which is itself totally anti-rational and 
anti-materialist. This is completely opposed to 
Descartes (whose rationalism leads eventually 
but directly to materialism). For me to invoke 
the question of doubt or of non-doubt and to 
either assert or to question the reality of the 
world would be completely futile. The principle 
fundamentally and from the very beginning is 
that there is no objectivity to the world. 

But nevertheless one has to recognise the reality 
of the illusion; and one must play upon this 
illusion itself and the power that it exerts. This is 
where the Manichaean element in my work 
comes in. It is a question which, really, is purely 
strategic. 

We can compare this position easily with that of 
Freud if you like — with his juxtaposition of the 
principles of Eros and Thanatos. These two 
principles are at first absolutely opposed to each 
other. But there is also the crucial moment in 
Freud's work when, having desperately 
attempted to unify and integrate the two, he 
finally abandons the project and invokes instead 
the principle of their total irreconcilability. This 
is something that works very much to the 
advantage of the principle of Thanatos itself, 
since of course Thanatos is itself the principle of 
irreconcilability. 

This is the key to the whole position: the idea is 
that of a most fundamental and radical 
antagonism, of no possibility existing at all of 
reconciling the 'illusion' of the world with the 
'reality' of the world. And I have to say this once 
again: here the 'illusion' is not simply irreality or 
non-reality; rather, it is in the literal sense of the 
word (il-ludere in Latin) a play upon 'reality' or a 


raise en jeu of the real. It is, to say it one more 
time, the issuing of a challenge to the 'real' - the 
attempt to put the real, quite simply, on the spot. 

There is here a fundamental distinction — which 
it seems to me exists in the whole history of 
thought in general. There is the principle of the 
possibility of reconciliation on the one hand, and 
there is the recognition of total irreconcilability 
on the other hand. For me the reality of the world 
has been seduced, and this is really what is so 
fundamentally Manichaean in my work. Like 
the Manichaeans I do not believe in the 
possibility of 'real-ising' the world through any 
rational or materialist principle -- hence the 
great difference between my work and the 
process of invoking radical doubt as in Descartes. 

A.C.: Did semiology arrive to save meaning 
precisely at a point when it was already lost? Is 
semiology a nostalgic, a romantic project? 

J.B.: I do not really know about the nostalgia of 
semiology: one must believe in the first place that 
meaning did once exist -- and so you could then 
attempt to try to find it again, at least as a lost 
object ... Obviously I do not believe this, so the 
nostalgia might have been there in semiology but 
it would have been in my view totally unfounded. 
One thing is certain: semiology did attempt — and 
does still — to save meaning and to produce 
meaning as a sort of repudiation or conjuration of 
non-sense, and in that light semiology as a 
discipline does appear to be evangelical. And this 
is so in spite of the fact that today in semiology 
there is to a certain extent an awareness of 
production, of its own production of signs. 

The problem arises in the way that semiology 
operates: in so far as it immediately establishes a 



44 


Interview with Jean Baudrillard 


Interview with Jean Baudrillard 


45 


distinctive opposition between signifier and 
signified :md between sign and referent, etc., 
from the very first point of departure what 
semiology tries to do is to domesticate the sign. 
By comparison, in the world which I evoke, the 
one where illusion or magic thought plays a key 
role, the signs evolve, they concatenate and 
produce themselves, always one upon the other — 
so that there is absolutely no basic reference 
which can sustain them. Thus they do not refer 
to any sort of 'reality' or 'referent' or 'signified' 
whatsoever. So in this situation what we have is 
the sign alone; and it is the power which is proper 
to the sign itself, it is the pure strategy of the sign 
itself that governs the appearance of things. This 
position is vastly different from semiology - as 
for instance in Lacan and in the Tel Quel school, 
where a primary role is given to the 'signifier'. In 
other words, for me the sign is, if you like, 
without recourse. There is no basic reserve, no 
'gold standard' to the sign - no basic reserve of 
reference from which the sign can be recovered or 
accommodated. On the contrary, reality is the 
effect of the sign. The system of reference is only 
the result of the power of the sign itself. 

This is what Artaud meant when he talked about 
the 'savage power' of the sign, when he alluded to 
this 'cruel' capacity that the sign has to 'erupt' 
and so on. The framework here for an 
understanding of the effect of the sign is hardly a 
representational one. Rather, the framework is 
the fundamental antagonism between the sign 
and reality: here the sign is precisely that which 
operates against reality, not for it. From this 
point of view, there is really no semiology at all, 
properly speaking. No real logos (as is implied in 
the couple 'signified/signifier', etc.) is available. 
Instead, we have a sort of single brutal sign 
which exists in its purest state and which goes 


through the universe, simply reproducing itself, 
constantly and forever. In the representational 
system, one cannot do this. ( )ne cannot go from 
one sign to another directly; one must mediate 
from one sign to another through meaning, 
through the duality 'signified/signifier' and so on. 
This is why I invoke tin' concept of destiny, the 
concept of the destiny of the sign whereas what 
semiology invokes is a concept of the history of 
the sign, the history of the sign as a domesticated 
product of meaning. This domestication process, 
of course, is also to be found in other disciplines — 
in psychology, for example and to me it seems 
to be only a desperate attempt to seek salvation... 

Having said all this, it is true that semiology has 
become much more sophisticated in the last few 
years. So today we have a semiology of poetry, for 
example, or of the speech act, of langue and 
parole. A lot of attempts are being made to go 
beyond the representational mode, which was 
obviously deficient. But in my opinion semiology 
will never be able — to adopt the coinage of 
Nietzsche - to go beyond its shadow. It will never 
be actually able to find the sign in its purest state 
- in the way in which I, for example, try to do in 
De la Seduction and in the world of illusion. 

T.C./D.K.: In an earlier essay (’Design and 
Environment or How Political Economy 
Escalates into Cyberblitz') you specified an 
historical moment when the object resigned its 
use value status by entering into a pure order of 
the sign function. In this essay your reference 
point is rather the media image. Has the media 
image supplanted the order of events and of 
objects in the same manner as the Bauhaus 
project of total design supplanted the realm of 
nature? And does the delirious proliferation of 



Interview with Jean Baudrill.nd 


47 


46 Interview with Jean Baudrillard 

the media image have a similarly specific 
historical moment? 

A propos this, can you explain the qualitative 
difference between the media image and those 
other forms (theatre, architecture, painting, 
language) that were incapable of overwhelming 
the real to such effect? 

J.B.: Yes, in a sense there is an historical shift. 
There is an historical evolution, which begins 
and also culminates with the phase where signs, 
as I said, lead from one another according to the 
logic of illusion. So this was indeed a first stage — 
not necessarily a chronological 'first' stage but 
certainly a logical one. And then the phase of 
rationality followed, with the production of the 
reality-effect by the sign. It seems to me that 
towards the end of this stage the sign found itself 
being separated and being sent back towards its 
own transcendence and immanence. What 
followed therefore was the game of the dialectic of 
the sign, the game whereby reality would be 
posited against the immanence or transcendence 
of the sign. Consequently, there is indeed a sort of 
historical movement. 

The movement reaches its apotheosis in the 
arrival of the media. Now, once again, the sign is 
all alone. But this is not to say that we are back 
at the first stage once more. The situation now is 
different. Now the sign seems to me to posit what 
I have called the 'principle of hyperreality'. That 
is, what we have now is the disappearance of the 
referent -- and it is in relation to this 
disappearance of the referent that there is a sort 
of omnipresence to the sign. The problematic of 
the disappearance of the referent was not an 
issue according to the first logic of illusion; 
rather, there was simply no referent. So in a 


sense we are going back towards an anterior state 
-- but nevertheless with a difference. 

Is this evolution an historical one? 1 do not think 
it is. It is, rather, a metaphysical one: the 
universe of the media which wo are currently 
immersed in is not the magical universe or the 
cruel universe which we had atari anterior stage, 
where the sign was operational purely on the 
basis of its own functioning as sign. With the 
advent of the media, it seems to me that we have 
lost that prior state of total illusion, of the sign as 
magic. We are, in other words, in that state of 
'hyperreality' as I have called it. Now we are 
dealing with a sign that posits the principle of 
non-reality, the principle of the absolute absence 
of reality. We went beyond tin 1 reality principle a 
long time ago, and now the game which is being 
played is no longer being played in the world of 
pure illusion. It is as if we are now in a shameful 
and sinful state, a post-illusion state. 

We can try to put this another way, if you like: as 
we all know, philosophy is based on the negation 
of the real. There is at the heart of philosophy a 
primordial act regarding the negation of reality; 
and without that negation there is no philosophy. 
Now, it seems to me that throughout a certain 
period this negation was the privilege of 
philosophers. But today this is no longer the 
case. Today the negation of the real has 
penetrated inside things themselves, so much so 
that it is no longer the privilege of just 
philosophers but an axiom that belongs to all. 
What has happened is that the negation of reality 
has now been incorporated into 'reality' itself. In 
short, what we have now is a principle of non- 
reality based on 'reality' -- a principle of 
'hyperreality' as I call it. The mutation is 
interesting, since it implies nothing other than 


48 


49 


Interview with Jean Baudrillard 

the end of philosophy. The philosophical 
principle of the negation of reality has now 
pervaded everyday 'reality' itself. 

This is why I say that today we have a form of 
irony which is objective. Irony can no longer 
today be simply the subjective irony of the 
philosopher. It can no longer be exercised as if 
from outside of things. Instead, it is the objective 
irony which arises from within things themselves 
- it is an irony which belongs to the system, and 
it arises from the system itself because the 
system is constantly functioning against itself. 

Now to go to the second part of the question -- the 
Bauhaus question. The Bauhaus project of total 
design is certainly one of the important episodes 
in the evolution of simulation, which marks the 
passage of the sign from the dialectic of the real 
to the order of the sign itself. Nevertheless, the 
Bauhaus project does not go to the stage of 
seduction of the real, and there are radical 
differences between simulation and seduction. 
The Bauhaus remains at the stage of simulation. 
To say it once more: seduction seems to me to 
invoke an enchanted universe, whereas 
simulation invokes a universe which is totally 
disenchanted and , as I said, almost shameful. 

And finally, the last part of the question: in my 
view there is no substantial qualitative 
difference between electronic media such as TV 
on the one hand and other forms such as 
language, painting or architecture on the other 
hand. In my opinion there is no real difference 
between them; they all operate at the same level, 
that of simulation. Of course one would have to 
discuss this at some length, and in any case I am 
not an expert in any of these areas. However, it 
does seem to me, for example, that simulation has 


Interview with Jean Baudrill.nd 

invaded theatre just as much as it has invaded 
painting, and that as a result neither of them 
have the power to exert total illusion any longer. 
Both the theatre and painting have entered the 
order of simulation and in fact they now typify 
simulation. 

So all the forms can in fact be substituted one for 
another. They have all been contaminated by 
simulation, and so now they function in terms of 
’communication’ and ’information’, which are 
nothing other than the by products of simulation. 
Neither architecture nor painting, for instance, 
have today any effects which are proper to 
themselves; instead, today they function merely 
as indications of the transformation of the world. 

We must remember this: the aim of art was once 
precisely to posit the power of illusion against 
reality. There was a time when art was trying to 
make reality play a game which was different to 
the game that art itself was playing. In other 
words, there was a time indeed when art was 
always trying to force reality to play the game 
along different rules, when it was always trying 
to seduce the reality of things. But today this is 
no longer the great game that art is playing. All 
the art forms are now playing the game at the 
level of the simulation of reality — and whether 
the particular art form be painting or 
architecture makes no difference whatsoever. 

That is, there is no longer any great ’challenge’ 
being posited by these art forms — a challenge to 
go beyond the reality principle. For example, the 
very project of the Bauhaus (which incorporated, 
of course, all of the various art forms) was 
precisely and by definition the attempt to design 
the world — and this attempt does not make any 
sense unless the world is being considered in 


50

terms of the reality of its things. This is very 
different from the attempt to confront the world 
with the non-reality of its things, and really it is 
simply a sort of exercise of simulation. But all 
this is open to discussion and I would like one day 
to be able to analyse the issues in greater detail...
